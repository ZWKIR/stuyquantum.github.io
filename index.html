            <p class="w3-center w3-large" style="color:#5a2320; font-weight: bold;">Our Purpose</p>
            <p>StuyQuantum focuses on creating a strong community where 
                students can learn about quantum computing and its different 
                applications. This club will expose students to a realm of 
                science they may not have learned about before and will allow 
                them to connect the knowledge they learn about quantum computing 
                with real life scenarios. Quantum computing can often be seen as 
                a daunting field of science and this club aims to get rid of any 
                fear associated with it. We hope to either inspire students to 
                pursue quantum computing or just provide them with knowledge that 
                they can take into their future careers. We wish to provide students 
                with resources and connections that will benefit them in whatever 
                career path they take. We will teach our members important concepts 
                in quantum computing and different tools, such as qiskit(IBM), 
                azure(Microsoft), etc. We hope to have talks with experienced people 
                in this field, visit tech companies in this field, attend hackathons, 
                and work on long term projects as a group.</p>

            <p class="w3-center w3-large" style="color:#5a2320; font-weight: bold;">Why join us?</p>
            <p>What makes this organization unique is that it provides students with 
                numerous resources and a strong community with which they can learn 
                about quantum computing. Quantum computing is not taught in STEM 
                classes in school. Our club hopes to educate students in this field, 
                especially as it becomes increasingly relevant and important. We want 
                to provide students with knowledge in this field as they don't seem to 
                be getting it anywhere else. Although students can get this information 
                online, our club aims to teach students about quantum computing in a fun 
                and structured way, and provide a close community they can be a part of.</p>

        <div class="w3-row-padding w3-center" style="margin-top:32px;margin-left: 12%;margin-right: 12%;background-color:rgb(122, 51, 51,0.5);border-radius: 40px;">
            <p class="w3-center w3-large" style="color:#5a2320; font-weight: bold;">Our Benefits</p>
            <p>Quantum computing has become an increasingly popular and important subject. 
                It is considered to be the future because it allows us to solve large and 
                complex problems that would not be able to be solved on a classical computer. 
                As such, it is important for students to be able to learn about this interesting, 
                new field of science. This club will help teach students about different and 
                important concepts related to quantum computing. It will provide a community 
                in which students can learn and grow with others who have the same interests 
                as them. This club is open to students of all backgrounds and levels. We want 
                to provide all students with the resources and community through which to 
                explore quantum computing and make an impact in the field. We encourage everyone 
                and anyone to join. Not only will students be able to gain conceptual knowledge 
                in this field, but they will also be able to learn from experienced professionals 
                and make connections with them. We will provide students with many opportunities 
                to practice their skills, including possible hackathons, visits to companies, 
                long-term club projects, resources and tools with which they can explore on their 
                own, such as IBM qiskit, Microsoft azure, Google cirq, etc.</p>
